    "- You have to fill in the code to this notebook and upload it to your repository. And simply, submit the link to the repo (which has all the lab submissions inside it). I know the link would be same over the submissions, but it's a simple way to map you on DEN and Github. Also, the jupyter notebook file name has to be in the form '(First name)-(Last name)-lab(Lab Number)'. All characters in lowercase. For example, first lab for me would be 'dhrumil-soni-lab1'  \n",
